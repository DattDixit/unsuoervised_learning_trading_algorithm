1. Garman-Klass Volatility
   - A method for estimating the volatility of an asset using high, low, opening, and closing prices.
   - It accounts for the range between the high and low prices, providing a more accurate measure than simple closing price-based volatility.
   - Formula: 
     σ^2 = 0.5 × (ln(High/Low))^2 - (2 ln(2) - 1) × (ln(Close/Open))^2
   - Commonly used in options pricing and risk management.

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Measures the speed and change of price movements.
   - It ranges from 0 to 100 and indicates overbought or oversold conditions.
   - A reading above 70 suggests an asset is overbought, while a reading below 30 suggests it is oversold.
   - Formula: 
     RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss)))

3. Bollinger Bands
   - A volatility indicator consisting of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands (standard deviations above and below the SMA).
   - The bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when it decreases.
   - Traders use them to identify potential buy/sell points based on price movements relative to the bands.
   - Formula:
     - Upper Band = SMA + (K × std dev)
     - Lower Band = SMA - (K × std dev)

4. Average True Range (ATR)
   - Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.
   - It considers the high-low range, high-close, and low-close ranges to provide a comprehensive view of price movement.
   - Useful in setting stop-loss levels and assessing market volatility.
   - Formula:
     ATR = (sum of TR over n periods) / n
     where TR (True Range) is the largest of: 
     - Current High - Current Low
     - Absolute value of Current High - Previous Close
     - Absolute value of Current Low - Previous Close

5. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - A momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.
   - It includes a signal line to indicate buy/sell opportunities.
   - Formula:
     - MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
     - Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD Line
     - Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line
   - Positive MACD suggests upward momentum, while negative MACD suggests downward momentum.

6. Dollar Volume
   - Measures the trading activity of an asset by multiplying the volume of shares traded by the stock price.
   - It helps identify liquidity and the ease with which a position can be entered or exited.
   - Formula:
     Dollar Volume = Price × Volume
   - Higher dollar volume indicates better liquidity, making it a suitable candidate for trading.
